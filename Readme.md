# CrazyNFT #

The crazyNFT App is a revolutionary new NFT marketplace that runs entirely on a mobile device. It was made with the intention of keeping it easy to use for anyone. There's no need to have a wallet connected (it creates one for you on login, and is stored on secure servers), or have an indepth knownledge about NFTs to start using this app. Since it also utilises lazy minting, the artist can upload the NFT to marketplace without having to pay any gas fees, and can redeem the tokens once the sale is done.
